This small program blinks the last byte (optionally the two last bytes) of your IP after a successful WiFi setup on the built-in LED,
so you know the assigned IP without needing to look at the router:

_ .  ....  .. 

means your IP ends with 142.

if you prefer to show the two last bytes:

_ . ........  ........  _  ...  ..... 

means your IP ends with 188.035.
